6 Human Mage

=== Build Variations ===
Use 6 Mage As Core, Build with 3 mage at the start and use our strong ★★★ units or ★★ Tier 4/5 units as the base of the Variations alliance added (E.g. with 3 star storm and earth spirit, go spirits, with 2 star dragon knight/Keeper go knights)

=== Strength/Weakness ===
* Great when there is no mage in the lobby, counters most melee builds, can roll for ★★★ or fast level up
* RNG depended, can be countered by items like BKB, pipe, hood and scaled alliance. Little single target focus vs ★★★ carries.

=== Key Unit/Items: ===
* AOE Damage Hobgen!
* Barricade, Mana Boots (if only plan for 2 humans)
