This build can transition eventually into another build once you acquire the warborn set, the medal, and the relic! 
Warborn set has the following four items:
| Slot      | Piece                       | Acquire Method        |
|-----------|-----------------------------|-----------------------|
| Head      | Mythical Warborn Visor      | Blueprint Craft       |
| 1H        | Mythical Warborn Gavel      | Drop/Blueprint Reroll |
| Chest     | Mythical Warborn Chestguard | Drop/Blueprint Reroll |
| Shoulders | Mythical Warborn Pauldrons  | Drop/Blueprint Reroll |

Once you have the Visor BP, you can reroll it into the other pieces.
The other pieces are acquired below:
| Slot    | Piece                              | Acquire Method             |
|---------|------------------------------------|----------------------------|
| Rings   | Coven Storm Seal                   | Buy from Coven of Ugdenbog |
| Amulet  | Empowered Essence of Beronath      | Blueprint Craft            |
| Offhand | Mythical Beronath, Reforged        | Blueprint Craft            |
| Pants   | Mythical Chausses of Barbaros      | Drop                       |
| Boots   | Mythical Boneshatter Treads        | Drop                       |
| Belt    | Mythical Reforged Chains of Oleron | Drop                       |
| Medal   | Mythical Korvaak's Brand           | Drop                       |
| Relic   | Serenity                           | Blueprint Craft            |

Once you have this  you can transition to this build:
https://www.grimtools.com/calc/JVlWxdo2
This build removes Overguard and focuses harder on the passives.
Devotion removes a couple Circuit Breakers and gets a couple damaging Devotions
Overall, your gear gives you much more protection, so your build can focus harder on damage. Unfortunately, because the gear is hard to get you'll have to wait until you have the gear before you swap.
The gear here cuts out a ton of RNG as there are only 4 items that are only gotten from drops! You can craft a large chunk of the build making it really viable! Unfortunately there is only one faction buy :( So you'll have to have all the blueprints ready for this to be truly easy to build.
