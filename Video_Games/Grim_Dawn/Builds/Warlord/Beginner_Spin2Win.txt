[[+Devotion]] | [[+Skill_Path]]

This build can transition eventually into another build once you acquire the warborn set!
Warborn set has the following four items:
| Piece                       | Slot      | BP? |
|-----------------------------|-----------|-----|
| Mythical Warborn Gavel      | 1H        | No  |
| Mythical Warborn Chestguard | Chest     | No  |
| Mythical Warborn Pauldrons  | Shoulders | No  |
| Mythical Warborn Visor      | Head      | Yes |

Once you have the Visor BP, you can reroll it into the other pieces.

Once you have this  you can transition to this build:

This build removes Overguard and focuses harder on the passives.
Devotion removes a couple Circuit Breakers and gets a couple damaging Devotions
Overall, your gear gives you much more protection, so your build can focus harder on damage. Unfortunately, because the gear is hard to get you'll have to wait until you have the gear before you swap.
