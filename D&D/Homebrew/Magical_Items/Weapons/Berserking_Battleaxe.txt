Battleaxe

Puts you in a 20th level Barbarian **Rage** when grasped with both hands. 
The following changes are made when you **Rage** using this weapon:
* You must attack the closest person within 30 ft. while you are in this **Rage** 
* When you start your turn and there are no creatures within 30ft of you, the **Rage** ends and you return to wielding the battleaxe in one hand
* The duration of **Rage **when using this weapon is unlimited
* You cannot stop the **Rage **as a bonus action, it only ends when there are no creatures within 30ft of you or you are knocked unconcious.

The modified version of **Rage** is listed below:

**Rage:**
In battle, you fight with primal ferocity. On your turn, you can enter a rage by switching to a two-handed grip on your battleaxe.

While raging, you gain the following benefits if you aren’t wearing heavy armor:

* You have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.
* When you make a melee weapon attack using Strength, you gain a +4 bonus to the damage roll.
* You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.
* If you are able to cast spells, you can’t cast them or concentrate on them while raging.

Your rage lasts indefinitely. It ends early if you are knocked unconscious or if you start your turn and there are no creatures within 30ft of you.
