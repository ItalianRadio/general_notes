Requires Full Attunement
Ring

While you're attuned to this ring, as a bonus action you can summon either a **Shadow Blade** (as the spell) or a **Phantasmal Blade** to your hand. You can only have one such blade out at a time and if you summon a blade to your hand while another is out the original disappears.

These weapons share proficiency with shortswords and have the finesse, light, and thrown properties (range 20/60). If you drop the weapon or throw it, it dissipates at the end of the turn. Thereafter, while you have the blade "summoned", you can use a bonus action to cause it to reappear in your hand.

The **Shadow Blade** has the property of when you use it to attack a target that is in dim light or darkness, you make the attack roll with advantage. The blade deals 2d8 psychic damage on a hit, but additional damage dealt with the blade (such as that from sneak attack) is dealt as piercing damage.

The **Phantasmal Blade** has the property that it causes an area surrounding you to become darker as if the shadows are drawn to you. While you are holding the blade bright light within 10ft of you becomes dim light and dim light becomes darkness. The blade deals 2d6 necrotic damage, but additional damage dealt with the blade (such as that from sneak attack) is dealt as piercing damage.
