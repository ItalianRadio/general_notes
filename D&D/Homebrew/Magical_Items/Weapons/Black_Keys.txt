====== Black Keys ======
Created Wednesday 05 June 2019

Requires Full Attunement
+3 Dual Shortswords/One Longsword
Blades, hilt, and guard of these weapons are completely black. When the weapon changes form, a discordant chime is played as if you hit all the black keys on a piano.

As a bonus action you can put the shortswords together into a longsword or take the longsword apart and be left with two shortswords. 

If the weapon has changed form since the start of your last turn you get the following benefits depending on what form the keys are in:
* If the swords are in longsword form, the longsword is **vorpal**.
* If the swords are in shortsword form, they both deal an additional 1d10 slashing damage.

**Vorpal Description:**
The weapon ignores resistance to slashing damage.
When you attack a creature that has at least one head with this weapon and roll a 20 on the attack roll, you cut off one of the creature’s heads. The creature dies if it can’t survive without the lost head. A creature is immune to this effect if it is immune to slashing damage, doesn’t have or need a head, has legendary actions, or the GM decides that the creature is too big for its head to be cut off with this weapon. Such a creature instead takes an extra 6d8 slashing damage from the hit.
