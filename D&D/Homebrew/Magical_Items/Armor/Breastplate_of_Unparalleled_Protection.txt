Created Wednesday 05 June 2019

No Attunement - Cursed! RC8
+? Breastplate

Cursed, requires //Remove Curse //cast as an 8th level spell to remove it from the wearer
Removing the armor removes all the benefits and curses the armor applies to the wearer. If a creature puts the armor back on after doffing it, they return to the level of magical advancement they were previously at. If a new creature dons the armor, they start from magical advancement level zero. 

While wearing this set of armor you cannot feel pain

Each time you are knocked unconcious your skin becomes more stone-like

If you are knocked unconcious or killed, the first 1st - 5th times the armor is given an additional +1 magical modifier to AC

The 6th time you are knocked unconcious or killed, instead you lose 5 movement speed to all types and you lose the ability to fly by non-magical means 

The 7th time, you gain resistance to bludgeon, piercing, and slashing damage

The 8th time, you become immune to non-magical bludgeon, piercing, and slashing damage

The 9th time, you no longer need to eat, drink, breath, and you no longer age 

The 10th time, you are petrified (as //Flesh to Stone//) and the effect can only be removed by removing the **Breastplate**
