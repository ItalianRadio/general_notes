====== R--Stargazer ======
Created Tuesday 18 June 2019

//Wondrous item, rare//

During a long rest, if you use the //Stargazer// and spend an hour observing the night sky you will spot a shooting star. Roll 1d20 and record the result. Once before your next long rest you can replace the result of one die roll, on a die of any type, made by you or another creature you can see with this result. This property canâ€™t be used again until the next dusk.
