====== C--Ring of the Linguist ======
Created Tuesday 18 June 2019

//Ring, common//

This plain pewter ring sports a black stone of inky obsidian. It holds 1d4 unreplenishable charges of //comprehend languages//.
**Advancement.** Once per day, you can attempt to feed the stone a word. Doing so requires a DC 14 Intelligence check to accurately pronounce and define it. Three successes from a single language will cause the stone to turn as clear as water, and a small yellow fish can be seen floating inside. The stone can now act as a translator for that language, though it needs to be held up to the ear and leaves your lobe a little wet afterwards. The stone can learn an unlimited number of languages.
**Double advancement.** Once the ring knows five languages, the ring regains 1d4 charges of //comprehend languages// daily at dawn to a maximum of 4 charges.
