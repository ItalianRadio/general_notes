====== U--Potion of Door Jam ======
Created Tuesday 18 June 2019

//Potion, uncommon//

This little jar contains 1d6 + 1 servings of jam. If you smear a single serving on a door, it jams shut and requires a DC 20 Strength check to open. If you break an empty jar on a locked door, the door pops open and becomes ajar. It can be found in various flavors.
