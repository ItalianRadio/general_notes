====== U--Lip Stickers ======
Created Tuesday 18 June 2019

//Wondrous item, uncommon//

Inside this soft silken bag are 1d6 + 1 lip stickers. A sticker can be applied to a surface as an action to instantly cast the magic mouth spell on that location. Each lip sticker has a unique voice. They can be removed from the surface by hand, dispelling the effect, but cannot be reused.
