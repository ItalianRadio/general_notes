//Wondrous item, uncommon//

This item resembles a plain hobby horse with a mane of yellowed yarn, worn velvet button eyes, and a rein of soft golden chain. If you spend an action pantomiming riding a horse, complete with self-made horse noises and a name for your mighty beast, you cast phantom steed. Once used, this property canâ€™t be used again until the next dawn. The steed turns back into the hobby horse when the spell ends.
