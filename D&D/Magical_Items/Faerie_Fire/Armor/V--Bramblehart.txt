//Armor (shield), very rare (requires attunement)//

Wrought from the core of an ancient mother (page 83), this knotwork wooden shield is set with thorny vines and twisting brambles that lash out in your defense. 
When attuned to this +1 magic shield you gain resistance to lightning damage and the ability to cast the druidcraft cantrip.
In addition, when a creature misses a melee attack against you, you can use your reaction to make a grapple attempt against them. While wielding this shield, any creature you have grappled takes 1d4 plus your Wisdom modifier in piercing damage at the start of your turn.
