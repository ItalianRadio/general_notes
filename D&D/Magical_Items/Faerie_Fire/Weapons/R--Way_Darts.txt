====== R--Way Darts ======
Created Tuesday 18 June 2019

//Weapon (darts), rare (requires attunement)//

This set of three magical darts grants a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls. Once attuned, you develop an intrinsic link to the darts: you can blink to any dartâ€™s location within 60 feet of you as a bonus action, or as a reaction to the dart making impact.
If you cannot fit in the same space as the dart, you appear in an unoccupied space within 5 feet. If no space is available within 5 feet, you are moved to the next available open space and take 1 point of force damage for every foot removed. If the dart is stuck to a creature or object, the creature or an adjacent creature can remove it as an object interaction on their turn.
You can will a dart back to you as an bonus action on your turn. Creatures capable of seeing the ethereal can see the tethers between the darts and their owner.
