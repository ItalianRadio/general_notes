====== A--The Illuminated Blade ======
Created Tuesday 18 June 2019

//Weapon (shortsword), artifact (requires attunement by a spellcaster)//

//The Illuminated blade// is a sentient sword fueled by ambition; for as long as you carry it, the blade drives you on to greater feats with every success, and into madness with every failure.
You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. While attuned to //the Illuminated blade// you are proficient with it and it acts as a spellcasting focus; you can also use your spellcasting ability instead of Strength or Dexterity for attack and damage rolls made with this weapon. 
While you have spell slots remaining //the Illuminated blade// casts bright light equal to 5 feet times the level of your highest available spell slot, to a maximum of 30 feet.
**Will of the Wielder.** As an action you can expend a Hit Die to will the sword to take the form of any sword that deals slashing damage.
**Barrier.** While attuned to this weapon you are always under the effect of the spell //mage armor// and always have the spell //shield// prepared. In addition, each dawn the sword casts //false life// on you without expending a spell slot at the same spell level as your highest available spell slot with a modified duration of 24 hours; if your temporary hit points are ever reduced to 0 the sword expends your lowest level spell slot as a reaction and casts //false life //on you again. You can oppose this expenditure as a reaction, but must succeed on a conflict against the sword. If you successfully oppose the sword in this way it does not attempt to expend any of your spell slots until dawn the next day.
**Bright Blade.** As an action on your turn, you can expend a 1st-level spell slot to send an arc of light searing out from the blade. The arc extends out from you as a 20-foot cone. Make a single melee spell attack roll against all targets in the cone; any target hit by the attack takes 1d12 + 1 force damage. If you use a spell slot of 2nd level or higher the damage increases by 1d12 + 1 and the size of the cone increases by 5 feet for each additional level.
**Reveal.** As an action you can expend a spell of 6th level or higher to grant great insight into a creature or object you can see within 30 feet. You gain information as if you have cast the //identify// and //legends lore// spells on the target and you have advantage on all rolls to interact with the target for the next hour. This includes ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws.
**Exploitation.** //The Illuminated blade// has modifications to handling conflicts with sentient items. When such a conflict occurs, the item makes an ability check using its highest ability score contested by your ability check. You must use your lowest ability score between Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma to make the check. If the sword attempts to take control, you must make a saving throw using your lowest ability score between Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma, with a DC equal to 12 + the sword’s highest ability score modifier. On a failed save, you are charmed by the blade for 1d4 days and you must do exactly as //the Illuminated// commands.
**False Immortality.** While attuned to this sword you cannot feel pain and your body doesn’t appear to age or take damage. In reality you still age, albeit at half the rate, and the effects of any damage taken while attuned to the sword are simply masked by illusion. The sword staunches any bleeding and stabilizes you whenever you are dying at the start of your turn. It also uses abjuration magic to mimic the capabilities of any lost limbs or body parts. These effects stop immediately once you are no longer attuned to the sword or you are within the area of an antimagic field.
**Sentience.** //The Illuminated blade// is a sentient, neutral blade with an Intelligence of 16, a Wisdom of 16, and a Charisma of 16. While attuned it replaces one of its ability scores with your highest ability score between Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma. For example, if your Intelligence is 17, Wisdom is 12, and Charisma is 18, it uses your Charisma score in place of its own. It has truesight out to a range of 15 feet. 
The blade communicates telepathically with you; it can speak, read, and understand all language. Its voice is distant and scholarly but grows nearer and more eager when pushing you on to greater challenges. The sword does not approve of failure and any time you encounter a setback that //the Illuminated blade //believes could have been otherwise avoided, it attempts to punish you by afflicting you with a madness. You must succeed on a conflict contest against the blade or gain a short-term madness. While the blade doesn’t want you impaired, it can be overzealous; for every short-term madness the sword has given you after your third such madness, roll a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, you gain a long-term madness. On a success you are simply afflicted with another short-term madness, but the next time the blade tries to strike you with a madness, the Wisdom save DC goes up by 2. Furthermore, if you receive more than three long-term madnesses during your time as the Illuminated champion, the blade may abandon you, imparting an indefinite madness when it does.
**Personality.** //The Illuminated blade// is a scholarly teacher that urges you on to greater challenges and discoveries with every triumph. When things are going well, it can be a charismatic, supportive mentor, instilling you with confidence and a feeling of accomplishment. Its wrathful, toxic side only becomes apparent when you have angered it or provoked it into conflict.
