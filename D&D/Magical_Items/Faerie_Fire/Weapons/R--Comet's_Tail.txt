====== R--Comet's Tail ======
Created Tuesday 18 June 2019

//Weapon (flail), rare (requires attunement)//

Forged from a captured comet, this flail’s head is connected by an icy-hot tether of magical energy. You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

**Make a Wish.** As a bonus action you can cause the comet’s orbit to increase from the flail. Until the end of your next turn, your reach with this weapon becomes 60 feet. The next time you hit a creature with this weapon both the target and each creature within 10 feet of it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be blinded until the end of their next turn.
**Star-studded.** On hit, you may choose to deal an additional 2d6 radiant damage to your target, up to two times per long rest.

Both properties recharge after one long rest spent beneath a starlit sky.
