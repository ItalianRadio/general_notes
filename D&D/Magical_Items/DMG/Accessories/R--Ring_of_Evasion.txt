====== R--Ring of Evasion ======
Created Thursday 13 June 2019

//Ring, rare (requires attunement)//

This ring has 3 charges, and it regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. When you fail a Dexterity saving throw while wearing it, you can use your reaction to expend 1 of its charges to succeed on that saving throw instead.
