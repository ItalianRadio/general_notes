====== V--Wand of Polymorph ======
Created Thursday 13 June 2019

//Wand, very rare (requires attunement by a spellcaster)//

This wand has 7 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 of its charges to cast the //polymorph// spell (save DC 15) from it.
The wand regains 1d6 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand's last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the wand crumbles into ashes and is destroyed.
