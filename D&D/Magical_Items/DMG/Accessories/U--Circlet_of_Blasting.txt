====== U--Circlet of Blasting ======
Created Wednesday 12 June 2019

//Wondrous item, uncommon//

While wearing this circlet, you can use an action to cast the //scorching ray// spell with it. When you make the spell's attacks, you do so with an attack bonus of +5. The circlet can't be used this way again until the next dawn.
