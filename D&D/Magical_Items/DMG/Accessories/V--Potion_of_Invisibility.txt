====== V--Potion of Invisibility ======
Created Thursday 13 June 2019

//Potion, very rare//

This potion's container looks empty but feels as though it holds liquid. When you drink it, you become invisible for 1 hour. Anything you wear or carry is invisible with you. The effect ends early if you attack or cast a spell.
