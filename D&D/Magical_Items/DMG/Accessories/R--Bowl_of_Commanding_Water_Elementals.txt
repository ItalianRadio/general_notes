====== R--Bowl of Commanding Water Elementals ======
Created Wednesday 12 June 2019

//Wondrous item, rare//

While this bowl is filled with water, you can use an action to speak the bowl's command word and summon a water elemental, as if you had cast the conjure elemental spell. The bowl can't be used this way again until the next dawn.
The bowl is about 1 foot in diameter and half as deep. It weighs 3 pounds and holds about 3 gallons.
