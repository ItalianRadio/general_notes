====== C--Pipe of Smoke Monsters ======
Created Tuesday 18 June 2019

//Wondrous item, common//

While smoking this pipe, you can use an action to exhale a puff of smoke that takes the form of a single creature, such as a dragon, a Rumph, or a froghemoth. The form must be small enough to fit in a 1-foot cube and loses its shape after a few seconds, becoming an ordjnary puff of smoke.
