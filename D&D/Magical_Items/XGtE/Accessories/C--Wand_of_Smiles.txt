====== C--Wand of Smiles ======
Created Tuesday 18 June 2019

//Wand, common//

This wand has 3 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 of its charges and target a humanoid you can see within 30 feet of you. The target must succeed on a DC 10 Charisma saving throw or be forced to smile for 1 minute.
The wand regains all expended charges daily at dawn. lf you expend the wand's last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the wand transforms into a wand of scowls.
