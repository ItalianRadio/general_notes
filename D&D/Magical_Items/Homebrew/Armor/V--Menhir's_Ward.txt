====== V--Menhir's Ward ======
Created Wednesday 05 June 2019

//Armor (full plate), very rare (requires attunement)//

This set of +2 full plate allows you to cast //Compelled Duel// once per turn without using an action. You do not have to concentrate on this //Compelled Duel// as the spirit of Menhir shall concentrate on it for you. You may only have one creature caught under this armor's effect at a time.
