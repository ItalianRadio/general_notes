====== A--Empyrion's Armor of Anger ======
Created Wednesday 05 June 2019

//Armor (full plate), artifact (requires attunement)//

This +2 set of full plate has faces smithed into it, while you are in battle they are constantly moving laughing and mocking. Sometimes hands appear making rude gestures. Follows the culture of whatever you're fighting.

Makes foes angry at you. Enemies starting their turn w/in 20ft of you must succeed on a Wisdom ST or be under the effects of //Compelled Duel//. On a failed save, the creature is drawn to you, compelled by your divine demand. While it is under these effects, it has disadvantage on attack rolls against creatures other than you, and must make a Wisdom saving throw each time it attempts to move to a space that is more than 30 feet away from you; if it succeeds on this saving throw, this spell doesn’t restrict the target’s movement for that turn. Unlike the normal spells the spell only ends if you attack a creature not under the **Anger Plate's** //Compelled Duel// effect or cast a spell that does not include a similar creature. At the end of each creature who is effected by the **Anger Plate's** //Compelled Duel//'s turn, they may retry the ST. Once a creature has succeeded aginst the **Anger Plate's** ST they are immune to its effects for 24 hours. 

The DC for this ST can be either your relevant Spellcasting Modifier or 8 + Proficiency + your Strength modifier. You can have any number of creatures under the effect of this skill at the same time.
