Created Wednesday 05 June 2019

//Weapon (glaive), rare (requires attunement)//

This +1 glaive sparkles like a prisim when the light catches it and when wielded, the glaive glows in alternating colors, cycling thru its eight colors randomly every six seconds.
At the beginning of each of your turns and after you have rolled initiative if you do not go first roll 1d8. Use the chart below to deduce what the glaive will do until the beginning of your next turn:

1. +1d8 fire damage on each attack
2. +1d8 cold damage on each attack
3. +1d8 lightning damage on each attack
4. +1d8 thunder damage on each attack
5. +1d8 acid damage on each attack
6. +1d8 necrotic damage on each attack
7. +1d8 radiant damage on each attack
8. On each successful attack you heal 1d8 HP
