//Weapon (cestus), very rare (requires attunement)//

This +2 cestus grants the following bonuses: If you hit a creature that is up to one size category larger than you, you may force said creature to make a Strength saving throw where the DC is equal to 8 + proficiency + your Strength or Wisdom modifier (your choice). On a failure, you may move up to 5ft without provoking attacks of opportunity and then move the creature to a space within 5 ft of your new location.
