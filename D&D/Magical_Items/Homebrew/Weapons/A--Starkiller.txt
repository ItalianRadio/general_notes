====== A--Starkiller ======
Created Wednesday 05 June 2019

//Weapon (any sword), artifact (requires attunement)//

This inky black +3 sword's blade is dotted with bright lights appearing as the night sky had been forged into a blade.

When making an attack with the **Starkiller**, you use your choice of your Strength or your relevant spellcasting modifier for the Attack and Damage Rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

Once per day you may cast //melf's minute meteors// targeting each enemy within 120ft twice using your releveant spellcasting modifier.  When you use the **Starkiller** in this way the sky goes black wiping out the sun, moon, and stars. Afterwards the user falls unconcious until the end of their next turn.
