====== L--Bloodraker ======
Created Wednesday 05 June 2019

//Weapon (any sword), legendary (requires attunement)//

This +3 sword has a fearsome aura that when unsheathed will cause creatures with less than 20 HP to be frightened of the wielder while they stand within 30ft.
Whenever you kill a foe with the **Bloodraker** in hand you are granted 5 temporary HP. If you already have temporary HP granted by the **Bloodraker** then add 5 temporary HP to your current temporary HP value, otherwise you must replace your current temporary HP with temporary HP granted by the **Bloodraker** to receive the other benefits. Temporary HP granted by the **Bloodraker** is removed when you complete a long rest.

While you have temporary HP granted by the **Bloodraker**, you gain the following benefits:
* Advantage on Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, and Wisdom saving throws
* Advantage on attack rolls made with the **Bloodraker**
* Advantage on all skill checks that aren't Intelligence or Wisdom

Every day you are attuned to the **Bloodraker **you must draw the blood of a new creature. If you do not you must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw where the DC is the number of times you have failed this roll plus 10. On a failure you receive a madness, the level of which is determined by the number of failures.

You might find it prudent to un-attune to the **Bloodraker** during your downtime, or only to attune to it the night before a big battle. This will work and has been tested. Thoroughly.

Madness Level:
1-5: Short Term
6-10: Long Term
11+: Indefinite
