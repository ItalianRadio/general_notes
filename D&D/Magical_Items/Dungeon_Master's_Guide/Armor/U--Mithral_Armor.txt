====== U--Mithral Armor ======
Created Thursday 13 June 2019

//Armorâ€‚(medium or heavy, but not hide), uncommon//

Mithral is a light, flexible metal. A mithral chain shirt or breastplate can be worn under normal clothes. If the armor normally imposes disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks or has a Strength requirement, the mithral version of the armor doesn't.
