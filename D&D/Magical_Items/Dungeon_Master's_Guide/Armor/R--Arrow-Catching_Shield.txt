====== R--Arrow-Catching Shield ======
Created Wednesday 12 June 2019

//Armor (shield), rare (requires attunement)//

You gain a +2 bonus to AC against ranged attacks while you wield this shield. This bonus is in addition to the shield's normal bonus to AC. In addition, whenever an attacker makes a ranged attack against a target within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to become the target of the attack instead.
