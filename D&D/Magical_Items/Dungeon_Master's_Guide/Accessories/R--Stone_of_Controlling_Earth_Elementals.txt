====== R--Stone of Controlling Earth Elementals ======
Created Thursday 13 June 2019

//Wondrous item, rare//

If the stone is touching the ground, you can use an action to speak its command word and summon an earth elemental, as if you had cast the //conjure elemental// spell. The stone can't be used this way again until the next dawn. The stone weighs 5 pounds.
