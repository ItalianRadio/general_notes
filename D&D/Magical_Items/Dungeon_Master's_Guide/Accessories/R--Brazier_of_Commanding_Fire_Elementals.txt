====== R--Brazier of Commanding Fire Elementals ======
Created Wednesday 12 June 2019

//Wondrous item, rare//

While a fire burns in this brass brazier, you can use an action to speak the brazier's command word and summon a fire elemental, as if you had cast the conjure elemental spell. The brazier can't be used this way again until the next dawn.
The brazier weighs 5 pounds.
