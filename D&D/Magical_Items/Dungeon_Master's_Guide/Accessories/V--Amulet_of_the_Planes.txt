====== V--Amulet of the Planes ======
Created Wednesday 12 June 2019

//Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)//

While wearing this amulet, you can use an action to name a location that you are familiar with on another plane of existence. Then make a DC 15 Intelligence check. On a successful check, you cast the plane shift spell. On a failure, you and each creature and object within 15 feet of you travel to a random destination.
 Roll a d100. On a 1- 60, you travel to a random location on the plane you named. On a 61- 100, you travel to a randomly determined plane of existence.
