====== U--Potion of Animal Friendship ======
Created Thursday 13 June 2019

//Potion, uncommon//

When you drink this potion, you can cast the animal friendship spell (save DC 13) for 1 hour at will. Agitating this muddy liquid brings little bits into view: a fish scale, a hummingbird tongue, a cat claw, or a squirrel hair.
