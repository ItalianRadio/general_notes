====== U--Potion of Growth ======
Created Thursday 13 June 2019

//Potion, uncommon//

When you drink this potion, you gain the “enlarge” effect of the //enlarge/reduce// spell for 1d4 hours (no concentration required). The red in the potion's liquid continuously expands from a tiny bead to color the clear liquid around it and then contracts. Shaking the bottle fails to interrupt this process.
