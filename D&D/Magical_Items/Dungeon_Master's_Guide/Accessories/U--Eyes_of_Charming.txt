====== U--Eyes of Charming ======
Created Thursday 13 June 2019

//Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)//

These crystal lenses fit over the eyes. They have 3 charges. While wearing them, you can expend 1 charge as an action to cast the //charm person// spell (save DC 13) on a humanoid within 30 feet of you, provided that you and the target can see each other. The lenses regain all expended charges daily at dawn.
