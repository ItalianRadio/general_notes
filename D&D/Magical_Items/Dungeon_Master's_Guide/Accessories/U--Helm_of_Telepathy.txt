====== U--Helm of Telepathy ======
Created Thursday 13 June 2019

//Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)//

While wearing this helm, you can use an action to cast the //detect thoughts// spell (save DC 13) from it. As long as you maintain concentration on the spell, you can use a bonus action to send a telepathic message to a creature you are focused on. It can reply—using a bonus action to do so—while your focus on it continues.
While focusing on a creature with //detect thoughts//, you can use an action to cast the //suggestion// spell (save DC 13) from the helm on that creature. Once used, the //suggestion// property can't be used again until the next dawn.
