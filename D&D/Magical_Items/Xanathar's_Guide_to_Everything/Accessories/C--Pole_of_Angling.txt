====== C--Pole of Angling ======
Created Tuesday 18 June 2019

//Wondrous item, common//

While holding this 10-foot pole, you can speak a command word and transform it into a fishing pole with a hook, a line, and a reel. Speaking the command word again changes the fishing pole back into a normal 10-foot pole.
