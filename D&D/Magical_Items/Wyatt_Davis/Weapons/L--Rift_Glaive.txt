====== L--Rift Glaive ======
Created Friday 23 August 2019

//Weapon (glaive), legendary (requires attunement)//

The blade of this red-handled naginata looks to be made of gold, but is far more durable. You gain a +3 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. It has 8 charges, and recovers 1d8 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn.
**Rift Beam.** You can use an action to expend a charge to perform a Rift Beam attack. Each creature in a 30-foot line that is 5 feet wide must make a Strength saving throw with a DC equal to 8 + your proficiency + attack modifier. On a failed save, the creature takes damage as if they had been attacked and is pushed 5 feet away perpendicular from the line (caster's choice of direction) and cannot make reactions until the start of their next turn.
The Rift Beam can also create temporary tunnels in nonmagical walls. The tunnels last for 1 minute before closing and extend for up to 30 feet from where the rift beam originated. The tunnels are a distortion of space and do not cause structural damage.
