Created Wednesday 05 June 2019

//Weapon (any sword), artifact (requires attunement by a spellcaster)//

The sword whispers secrets of the world to you. Will you fail to understand?

**Trust. **The sword will grow to **trust** you the more you use it. The more it trusts you the more unbelieveable and mind-blowing the secrets it will begin to tell you. Each time you deal damage with the **Scale** you increment the **trust** level. At higher **trust** levels the sword receives better bonuses. Be careful though, as the sword does not know your limits and may begin to tell you things that may injure your mind! Incrementing the trust level to a new gate will incurr an ever-increasing Wisdom saving throw that may injure your mind.
