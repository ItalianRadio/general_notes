//Weapon (any weapon with Reach), very rare (requires attunement)//

This weapon has a godly +6 bonus to hit and futher motivates the wielder by gently encouraging its wielder to miss less. If you roll a 1 to hit, reroll the attack against yourself! This effect only applies if the final die result is a 1. (Meaning you still reroll the one for a lucky halfling and do not attack yourself unless the subsequent roll is also a 1)
