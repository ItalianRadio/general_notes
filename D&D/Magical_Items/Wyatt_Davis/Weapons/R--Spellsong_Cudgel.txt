//Weapon (any club or staff), rare (requires attunement)//

This +2 club causes the bearer to hear a fragment of an ancient song whenever it is used to strike a foe.
While you are attuned to the club,  when making an attack with this weapon, you **must** use your choice of your Intelligence modifier for the Attack and Damage Rolls. If you deal damage with this weapon you may use your reaction to cast //shield// on a creature within 5ft of you (including yourself) without using a spell slot.
