====== A--Empyrion's Coat of the Duelist ======
Created Wednesday 05 June 2019

//Wondrous item, artifact (requires attunement)//

If you are wearing medium or heavy armor the coat gives a bonus to your AC equal to your Dexterity modifier

Each time you attack or impose a ST on a foe w/in 30ft, the coat casts //Compelled Duel// as if you had cast it upon your target with your relevant spellcasting modifier. The coat may maintain concentration of one instance of //Compelled Duel// at a time.
