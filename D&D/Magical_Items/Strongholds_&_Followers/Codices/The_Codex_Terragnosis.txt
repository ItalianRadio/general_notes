====== The Codex Terragnosis ======
Created Tuesday 18 June 2019

//Wondrous item, artifact, requires attunement//

Written by Hierophant Prithviraña in the 738th year of the Age of Wonders, this book is a comprehensive treatise on the nature of the Mundane World and the material and philosophical principles that set it apart from Arcadia, Quintessence, and the World Below. 
This codex illuminates the Law of Nature, the Law of Time, and the Law of Death and contains a description of the world’s creation, the origins of divine and arcane magic, as well as the War Between the Gods.
The Hierophant built his wisdom and knowledge into the codex terragnosis. The book binds and shapes the world, defines it and defends it. While it resides within this manifold of the timescape, the Mundane World is safe.

==== The Barrier Between Worlds ====
While this book resides in the Mundane World, sending a native of this plane to another plane, unwillingly, requires a saving throw.

==== Steward of the Earth ====
Once per day, as an action, you can summon an elemental of your choice to do your bidding. After 1 hour, the elemental returns to its home plane.

==== Stone and Sea, Obey Me ====
Once per day, as an action, you can cast cataclysm.
**Cataclysm** (battle magic): Target: 4 units, Attack: +12, Power: +15. Enemy units damaged by this attack must make a DC 15 Morale save or decrement their casualty die twice.

==== Defender of All the Earth ====
Once, a druid who holds the codex terragnosis may assume the form of the phoenix (page 248). This form lasts until sunrise or sunset, whichever comes first, at which point the phoenix dies in a flare of brilliant light. The druid must make a Constitution save against DC 18 to survive the conflagration. The codex terragnosis itself survives the conflagration and, regardless of whether the druid lives, relocates itself somewhere safer, and the //Defender of All the Earth// ability recharges.
