====== The Codex Multiversalis ======
Created Tuesday 18 June 2019

//Wondrous item, artifact, requires attunement//

Certainly the first wizard to enter history as an owner of the Book of All Worlds was Padmavati, the Alienist. But thereâ€™s no actual record of her writing it, though scholarly consensus is that only she could have done so. Instead, the accepted wisdom is that she did write it, just not in this manifold. She is from a different world, sages presume. The truth may never be known. The deeds she performed are well-documented, including enacting The Forbidding, which permanently exiled the Demon Lord of Death to the Seven Cities of Hell. If the nature of this ritual is detailed in the //codex multiversalis//, no wizard since has deciphered it.
Attuning to the Book of All Worlds exposes you to the energies of a million worlds. This turns your eyes solid black. It does not damage your sight, but you are marked for as long as you stay attuned to the book.

==== Sight Beyond Sight ====
You immediately sense the direction, distance, and nature of any being summoned to the Mundane World of 9 Hit Dice or greater within thousand-mile radius. As an action, you can teleport to the site of the summoning within one minute of sensing it. You cannot use this ability again for 24 hours.

==== Traveler ====
Once per day, as an action, you can name a location you are familiar with in another world, and travel there.

==== Alienist ====
As an action, you can banish any creature not native to the plane you are on, sending them back to their plane of origin without a saving throw.

==== No Barrier Between ====
Once per day, as an action, you can summon any creature from any row of the Servitors chart (page 31).
They are free agents, not bound to serve you, and they return to their point of origin after 1 hour.
