//Wondrous item, artifact, requires attunement//

Exiled Empress Wu Jiao wasted no time planning her return to the throne and the restoration of the Wu dynasty. Her first goal was the return of her greatest general, the barbarian Lady Czorgan. As Czorgan was dead, this meant much research was in order. But Empress Jiao was already an accomplished wizard, and her first success took less than a year.
Emboldened by her necromantic research and the return of her right hand, Jiao pressed her study further and became the greatest necromancer in history. She succeeded in restoring her family to the throne, but history calls her the Dead Empress and her second period of rule the Dead Empire, granting her no narrative of restoration, only revenge.
Attuning to this dread book requires sacrificing 2 **Hit Dice**.

==== Unlife ====
Reading the Book of Death does not make you undead, but you quickly develop an affinity for the deathless. Your visage and demeanor change, becoming cold and pale. You gain the following attributes:
**Life Drain.** Whenever you deal melee damage, the target must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or its hit point maximum is reduced in equal amount to the damage taken. 
This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0. A humanoid slain by this attack rises 24 hours later as a zombie under your control, unless the humanoid is restored to life or its body is destroyed.
**Sunlight Sensitivity.** While in sunlight, you have disadvantage on attack rolls and on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.
**Undead Fortitude.** If damage would reduce you to 0 hit points, you may make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 5 plus the damage taken, unless the damage is radiant or from a critical hit. On a success, you drop to 1 hit point instead.

==== Legion of the Dead ====
Once per month, as an action, you can summon a legion of the dead—one unit each of ghoul infantry (page 257), skeletal archers, and wight cavalry (page 258). They remain under your control for 3 days or six battles, whichever comes first.

==== Lady Czorgan ====
As an action, you may sacrifice 2 Hit Dice and summon Lady Czorgan, the Death Knight (page 258). Lady Czorgan is a being of hatred and resentment who claws at the power of the Book that binds her, but she must obey you. You must concentrate to maintain Lady Czorgan’s presence in this world, which is limited to 1 hour, after which she returns to the Abyss and will not return for a month.

=== Master of Death ===
You automatically command any undead of less than 9 Hit Dice you meet or summon. Mastering undead is automatic for you and does not require an action. These undead obey your commands and serve you faithfully until they are destroyed. Up to 50 Hit Dice of undead can be mastered in this way.
Once an undead is mastered, it may not be replaced until it is destroyed.
