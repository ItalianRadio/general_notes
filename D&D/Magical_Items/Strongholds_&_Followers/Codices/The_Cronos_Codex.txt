====== The Cronos Codex ======
Created Tuesday 18 June 2019

//Wondrous item, artifact, requires attunement//

Like the codex multiversalis, the origins of the chronos codex are not well recorded. Its earliest reference is in the possession of the Ganarajyan wizard Subhadrangi, who may also be the book’s author. The book is also referenced in the Tales of Rupananda, but it’s possible Subhadrangi and Rupananda were the same woman. A handful of references talk of a sage who went by both names during that age, but there’s no direct confirmation from any contemporary source, and no source definitively claims either woman wrote it or indeed gives an independent account of the life of either. 
The Book of Time is the least well known of the codices. It tends to disappear for millennia at a time, and as a result, unlike the other Books of Magic, scholars are happy to leave it drifting in the eddies of the time stream.
It was only 300 years ago when the Khoursir scholar Chartam suggested that the book’s author had not yet been born, and that the book’s presence in the past of this time manifold is a result of its future author using its power. This once-fringe hypothesis has grown in popularity in recent years.

==== Summon Temporal Duplicate ====
Once per month, as an action, you can summon a version of yourself from the future. It is one possible version of your future character. It has your stats but is four levels higher and may have different items or even spells, at your GM’s discretion. You have no control over your temporal duplicate, but it is a version of you and will probably help you out. Because it is from one possible future, it is experiencing one possible past and may not remember the situation it finds itself in, because it never experienced this past.
The duplicate remains in this manifold of the timescape for 1d4 + 4 rounds, after which it returns to its own time. If it drops to 0 hit points, it automatically returns—unconscious—to its original manifold. 
While you are attuned to the book, the GM may ask you to make a percentile roll at random moments. If you roll a 100, you disappear for 4 + 1d4 rounds, as you are relentlessly pulled backward into an alternate past to serve a version of yourself four levels lower.

==== Nomad of the Timescape ====
You cease aging. Once per year, as an action, you may sacrifice any number of Hit Dice to move forward or backward in time by a hundred years per Hit Die sacrificed. You can observe and interact with, but cannot change, the past or future. Because of the manifold nature of the timescape, the past or future you find yourself in may not be your past or future.
While in another temporal manifold, you sacrifice 1 Hit Dice at the end of each week.

==== Clockwise ====
Once per month, as an action, choose a mortal enemy you can see within 60 feet. It must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or instantly advance into extreme old age. Its Strength, Constitution, and Dexterity are permanently halved. Because it gained no new experiences, its mental stats do not change. This effect can be reversed by a //greater restoration// spell cast within 24 hours of the time shift.

==== Jaunt ====
As a bonus action, choose a target and a number from one to six. If the target is willing, it is removed from the time stream and will reappear on initiative count 20 that number of rounds later. If it is unwilling, it can make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw to resist.

==== Blink of an Eye ====
As an action, you can sacrifice any number of Hit Dice to take an equal number of turns in a row.
