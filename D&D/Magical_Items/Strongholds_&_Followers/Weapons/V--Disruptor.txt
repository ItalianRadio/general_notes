====== V--Disruptor ======
Created Tuesday 18 June 2019

//Weapon (longsword), very rare (requires attunement by a chaotic creature)//

If you are a neutral character, this dull grey longsword functions as a normal weapon with no bonus or special properties. If you are lawful, touching Disruptor deals 2d8 necrotic damage to you. If you are a chaotic character, you can use Disruptor as a magic weapon with the following properties.
You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon. This bonus increases to +3 against lawful creatures. If an attack with Disruptor reduces a creature to 0 hit points, their chest bursts open and their organs spill out.
Whenever you score a critical hit with Disruptor, roll a d6 on the Court of All Flesh row of the Servitors chart (page 31). The critical hit lops a limb off the enemyâ€™s body, and the rolled servitor spawns from the severed flesh. This servitor fights for you and obeys your commands. They return to Morphosis after 1 minute or if they drop to 0 hit points.
