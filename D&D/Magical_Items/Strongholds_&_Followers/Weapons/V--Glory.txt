====== V--Glory ======
Created Tuesday 18 June 2019

//Weapon (mace), very rare (requires attunement by a good creature)//
If you are a neutral character, this steel mace functions as a normal weapon with no bonus or special properties. If you are evil, touching this weapon deals 2d8 radiant damage to you. If you are a good character, you can use Glory as a magic weapon with the following properties.
You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon, and may choose to do radiant or bludgeoning damage with this weapon. While wielding Glory, you glow with faint light.
Whenever you score a critical hit with Glory, roll a d6 on the Celestial Court row of the Servitors chart (page 31). Radiant light floods the battlefield and an angelic chorus begins to play. When the light dissipates, therolled servitor stands next to you. This servitor fights for you and obeys your commands. They return to their plane after 1 minute or if they drop to 0 hit points.
