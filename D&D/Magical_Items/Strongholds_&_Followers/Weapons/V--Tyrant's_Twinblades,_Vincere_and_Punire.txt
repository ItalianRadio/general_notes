====== V--Tyrant's Twinblades, Vincere and Punire ======
Created Tuesday 18 June 2019

//Weapon (shortsword), very rare (requires attunement by an evil creature)//

If you are a neutral character, these black iron shortswords function as normal weapons with no bonus or special properties. If you are good, touching either weapon deals 2d8 necrotic damage to you. If you are an evil character, you can use Vincere and Punire as magic weapons with the following properties.
You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with these magic weapons. Once per round, if both blades strike a single foe, they deal an extra 1d6 fire damage.
When you score a critical hit with either blade, roll a d6 on the Devils row of the Servitors chart (page 31). Flames burst from the ground and the rolled servitor appears. This servitor fights for you and obeys your commands. They return to Hell after 1 minute or if they drop to 0 hit points.
If this weapon strikes a demon, it shackles it and pulls it down to Hell, removing it from the battle.
