====== V--Harvest ======
Created Tuesday 18 June 2019

//Weapon (sickle), very rare (requires attunement by an evil creature)//
If you are a neutral character, this reaping tool functions as a normal weapon with no bonus or special properties. If you are good, touching Harvest deals 2d8 necrotic damage to you. If you are an evil character, you can use this sickle as a magic weapon with the following properties.
You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. This bonus increases to +3 against good creatures. If you reduce a living, mortal creature to 0 hit points, you regain 1d8 hit points.
Whenever you score a critical hit, roll a d6 on the Undead row of the Servitors chart (page 31). A bell
tolls and the rolled servitors burst from the ground. These undead fight for you and obey your commands. The undead turn to dust after 1 minute or if they drop to 0 hit points.
