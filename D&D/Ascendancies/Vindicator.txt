===== Eremite's Slash =====
At 1st rank, if you drop a foe below 0 hit points with a melee weapon wielded in two hands, you can make an attack on a foe that is both within your reach and within 5 feet of the foe you have just reduced below 0 hit points as a free action.

===== Heaven's Defense =====
Upon choosing this path at 1st rank, the first time you would drop below 0 hit points you instead drop to 1 hit point.
Once this ability has triggered, it cannot be used again until you complete a short rest.

===== Twin Moon Sweep =====
Beginning at 2nd rank, while you are wielding a melee weapon in two hands, you may use an action to attack each enemy within the reach of your weapon. For each foe hit with this ability, you regain hit points equal to your vindicator rank.
Once you use this ability you cannot use it again until you complete a long or short rest.

===== Zealot's Embrace =====
At 2nd rank, you can use an action to send a wave of immobilization in a line 5 feet wide from your position. The wave is a number of feet long equal to 5 times your vindicator rank. Creatures struck by this wave must succeed a Constitution saving throw or all attacks against them will have advantage and their movement speed will be set to 0 until the end of your next turn.
Once you use this ability you cannot use it again until you complete a short or long rest.

===== Heart of Fury =====
Starting at 3rd rank, you can use a bonus action to enter a zealous state of mind for 1 minute. While you are in this state you can use your bonus action to make an additional attack with a weapon you are wielding in two hands if you used your action to attack.
Once you use this ability you cannot use it again until you complete a long rest.

===== Chilling Victory =====
At 4th rank, while wielding a weapon with two hands, your weapon attacks deal bonus cold damage equal to your vindicator rank.

===== Heaven's Shield =====
Additionally at 4th level, you can use a bonus action to surround you and all allies within 10 feet in heaven’s shield, granting all affected creatures a shield bonus to AC until the start of your next turn. This bonus does not affect creatures already wielding a shield, nor does it stack upon itself or similar effects.

===== Avatar =====
 At 5th rank a vindicator can allow the Gods to work through them, allowing them to become a conduit for the heavens. As an action you can assume the form of a God’s avatar. While you are in an avatar state, you resist a type of damage, your attacks that would deal some form of physical damage (piercing, slashing, and bludgeoning) now deal an additional 1d12 of a second type of damage. An avatar lasts until you fall unconscious and changes your appearance entirely, but does nothing to change your demeanor. You may choose two damage types to gain resistance to when you assume the avatar state.
