==== Clones: ====
 An illusionist conjures and uses clones to its advantage. Clones dissipate after being struck by any damage. Clones share your statistics. They automatically pass all Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma saving throws and do not take damage from a passed saving throw. Clones automatically dissipate after 1 minute.
If you are not within sight, a clone is indistinguishable from you and would act as you would act. While you can say that they will attack someone, cast a spell, or something else, while they will appear to take that action, they cannot deal damage.
They can perform no actions other than movement options like jumping or climbing unless specified otherwise in an ability.
When you are present creatures that know you will innately be able to tell which is you and your closest friends will always be able to tell that your clones are not you.

===== Absorb Magic =====
Starting when you first become an illusionist you can use an action to cast counterspell as a 3rd level spell. If a spell is successfully countered using this feature you can choose one of the following benefits:
* Heal for a number of d8's equal to twice your illusionist rank.
* Regain a spell slot of a spell level equal to or lower than your illusionist rank.
Once you use this ability you must complete a long rest before you can use it again.

===== Altered Ego =====
Starting at 1st rank, you can use an action to conjure a clone at your location and teleport up to 15 feet away. Foes that were within 5 feet of you make an Wisdom (Insight) check contested by your Charisma (Deception) check to recognize that the clone is not you.
 Once you have used this ability a number of times equal to your illusionist rank you cannot use it again until you have completed a short rest.

===== Counterbore =====
Starting at 2nd rank, you can use a bonus action to shatter a clone that you can see within 60 feet. This deals a number of d8's equal to your illusionist rank as psychic damage to all foes within 15 feet of the clone. After the clone is shattered, it dissipates.

===== Phantasmal Image =====
At 2nd rank, you can use an action to conjure a clone in an unoccupied space you can see within 5 feet.

===== Alter Reality =====
At 3rd rank you can cause your illusions to momentarily become reality. As an action you cause a clone to become more real than usual for a turn. Until the end of this turn your clone may make an Attack action, cast a cantrip, or take the Dash or Dodge actions. If the clone deals damage to a creature on this turn, you may make a Charisma (Deception) check contested by the target's Wisdom (Insight) check. The target makes this check with Disadvantage. If you succeed, the target believes that the clone is the real you.

===== Mirror Match =====
At 3rd rank, if a foe causes you to suffer from a condition you can use your reaction to force them to succeed on a Charisma saving throw or suffer the same condition. This ability does not work if the creature has immunity to said condition.

===== Adephage =====
Starting at 4th rank, whenever you take bludgeoning, slashing, or piercing damage you can use your reaction to conjure a clone within 10 feet of you.

===== Trick of the Light =====
Upon reaching 4th rank, you can use a bonus action to swap places with a clone you can see within 30 feet.
Once you use this ability a number of times equal to your illusionist rank you must finish a long rest before you can use it again.

===== Aphotic Form =====
At 5th rank, your land speed increases by 5 feet, you cannot be slowed by anything, and you cannot be restrained except by grappling and similar physical effects (You cannot be restrained by spells, even those that use force to restrain you like Bigby's hand.)

===== Continuum Split =====
Once you reach 5th rank, you may use an action to active a continuum breach, destroying all clones you have conjured. For every clone that you destroyed in this way you gain 1 turn in the continuum breach. When you leave the continuum breach, your body reverts back to the way that it was before the breach. Your health returns to the number it was at before the breach and all spells and abilities that you used in the split are not used. If you are knocked unconscious or die during the Continuum Breach, at the end you return like nothing happened. You remember dying, but not what comes after.
Once you use this ability you must complete a long rest before you use it again.
