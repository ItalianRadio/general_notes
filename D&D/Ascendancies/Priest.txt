===== Kiss of Life =====
Your blessed kiss can heal wounds. You have a pool of Healing power that replenishes when you take a Long Rest. With that pool, you can restore a total number of Hit Points equal to your Priest Rank * 5.
As an action, you can kiss a creature and draw power from the pool to restore a number of Hit Points to that creature, up to the maximum amount remaining in your pool.
Alternatively, you can expend 5 Hit Points from your pool of Healing to cure the target of one disease or neutralize one poison affecting it. You can cure multiple Diseases and neutralize multiple Poisons with a single use of Kiss of Life expending Hit Points separately for each one.

===== Zealot's Speed =====
Starting at 1st rank, whenever you cause a creature to regain hit points, your movement speed increases by 10 feet for each creature you healed until the end of your turn. 
This effect stacks.

===== Angelic Mantra =====
Once you reach 2nd rank, you have become so proficient in healing that you can cause your spells to restore more than the normal amount of vitality. Whenever you cause a creature to regain hit points you can choose to restore the maximum number of hit points. You can use this ability a number of times equal to your Priest rank before you need to complete a long rest to use it again.

===== Symbol of Protection =====
At 2nd rank, you can use an action to smash a radiant symbol into the ground that protects your allies. This symbol has a radius of effect equal to 5 times your priest rank in feet.
While you or any of your allies are in the symbol, you have resistance to piercing, bludgeoning and slashing damage.
Once you use this ability you must complete a long rest before you can use it again.

===== Healing Mastery =====
At 3rd rank, you may choose a 1st-level spell that you know that can cause another creature to regain hit points. You may cast that spell without using a spell slot or using material components.

===== Runic Symbols =====
When you reach 3rd rank, you begin to integrate your knowledge of the ancient healing runes into your //Symbol of Protection//. Foes consider your //Symbol of Protection// to be difficult terrain and allies that start their turn standing on your //Symbol// have an additional 10 feet of movement speed until the end of their turn.

===== Circle of Healing =====
When you reach 4th rank, your //Symbol// gains the ability to spread out the healing spells that you cast. Whenever you cast a spell targeting a creature standing on your //Symbol// that causes that creature to regain hit points or gain temporary hit points, you may cause any number of other creatures also standing on your //Symbol// to get regain an equal number of hit points or temporary hit points.

===== Protective Spirit =====
Starting at 4th rank, you can use an action to place a protective spirit on target ally within 120 feet until the end of your next turn. While the spirit is in place the ally has resistance to all damage.

===== Healer's Boon =====
At 5th rank, you can use an action to place the healer's boon on yourself for 10 minutes. While you have the healer's boon on you, you can use any spell or ability that targets an ally as a bonus action instead of an action. Additionally, if you cast a spell in this way, you may cast another spell that uses an action that is not a cantrip so long as it does not target an ally.
Once you use this ability you must complete a long rest before you can use it again.	

===== Master of Symbols =====
Upon reaching 5th rank, you have mastered your //Symbol//, gaining the strength of those that created them. Allies you choose within your //Symbol// gain resistance to all damage while standing within your //Symbol//.
