===== Death Blossom =====
Starting when you become an assassin, you deal more damage with each strike upon a foe. Every third attack you make deals additional damage equal to 5 * your assassin rank. 

===== Shadow Step =====
Starting at 1st rank, you gain the ability to charge through shadows. When you are in dim light or darkness, as a bonus action you can teleport up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space you can see that is also in dim light or darkness. You then have advantage on the first melee attack you make before the end of the turn. 
If you already have this ability, the range at which you can teleport increases by a bonus equal to 5 * your assassin rank.

===== Smoke on the Wind =====
At 1st rank, if a foe you can see misses you with an attack, during your next turn you have an additional movement speed equal to 5 * your assassin rank. This effect does not stack. 

===== Feline Grace =====
At 2nd rank, if you are within 5 feet of any surface that would grant cover while you fall, you do not take fall damage, otherwise, fall damage you take is halved. Additionally, you have Advantage on Dexterity (Acrobatics) checks. 

===== Violent Escape =====
 At 2nd rank, as an action, you can make a melee finesse weapon attack against all foes within 5 feet of you. After completing your attacks, you teleport to a space within 5 feet of an ally that you can see within 60 feet. After teleporting your movement is set to 0 until the end of your turn. Once you use this ability you cannot use it again until you kill a foe or until you complete a short or long rest.

===== Mantis Fury =====
At 3rd rank, as a bonus action you enter the Mantis Fury stance until the end of your turn. All attacks you make while in the Mantis Fury stance hit with both your main hand and your off hand weapon at the same time. In addition, if you take the attack action this turn, you make one extra attack. Once you use this ability you cannot use it again until you kill a foe or until you complete a short or long rest.

===== Piercing Strikes =====
At 3rd rank, the sixth consecutive time you hit a foe, your attack will automatically become a critical hit unless the foe is immune to criticals. (This ability doesnâ€™t ensure that you hit, it ensures that when you hit, you deal critical attacks.) 

===== Shadow of Haste =====
When you reach 4th rank, as a bonus action you become one with your shadow until the end of your turn. While you are one with your shadow you have a bonus to your land speed equal to 5 * your assassin rank and your Strength (Athletics) and Dexterity (Acrobatics) checks have a +5 bonus. At the end of your turn after using this ability you return to the location that you used this ability at.

===== Shroud of Distress =====
Beginning at 4th rank, as a reaction you may activate this ability, healing you for 5 * your assassin rank and granting you a bonus to your AC equal to your assassin rank. Once you use this ability you must complete a short or long rest before you can use it again. 

===== Monkey Strength =====
Upon reaching 5th rank, If you run in a straight line at least 10 feet you may make a Strength (Athletics) or a Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. Using the results, choose a location somewhere within a number of feet from where you jumped equal to your check. This jump does not consume your movement.

===== Mastery of Self =====
When you reach 5th rank, if a foe you can see misses you with an attack, the next time you deal damage with an attack before the end of your next turn you deal bonus damage equal 2 * your assassin rank. This effect stacks.
