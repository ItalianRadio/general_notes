**Undead Fortitude.** If damage reduces the flesh golem to 0 hit points, it must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 5 + the damage taken, unless the damage is radiant or from a critical hit. On a success, the flesh golem drops to 1 hit point instead.
**Shambling Horror.** Upon reaching necromancer rank 4, when a flesh golem dies, it instead becomes a shambling horror, losing all its flesh and regaining all its hitpoints. Upon becoming a shambling horror it loses hitpoints equal to any excess damage beyond what would have killed the flesh golem. It loses the ability Undead Fortitude and gains the following resistances and immunities:
* **Damage Resistances:** piercing, slashing
* **Damage Vulnerabilities:** bludgeoning
* **Condition Immunities:** exhaustion

===== Player Actions =====
**Flesh to Flesh.** You can spend 30 seconds eviscerating a corpse with your flesh golem present to heal it to full health. This ability can be used on a dead flesh golem that died within the last minute to revive it, or on a shambling horror to transform it back into a flesh golem.
