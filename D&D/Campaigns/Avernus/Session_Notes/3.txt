Go to __Wasp Hive__ to save **Lulu**

Went in wasp hive via **Sutir** turning into a Giant Spider
When we got up there it was like fucking entombed angels were keeping the hive in the air
Creepy shit. There were angels in the walls

Killed a bunch of wasps and looted their trash piles as we start looking for **Lulu**

Found //Helm of Telepathy, //gave to **Sutir**, in hellwasp hive when we saved **Lulu**

Plan was:
—**Lulu** and **Kek** go to the roof to free the dead+suffering angels
—**Krikendolt **and **Sutir **collect hellwasp poison
—**Vizik** stands watch for more wasps next to **Cael**

Light wasp nest on fire after freeing the suffering dead angels. Metal as fuck flames

Decide to go to __Arkan's Tower__ after saving **Lulu**. There is veritable legion of undead and a white dragon circling it.
Decide to approach the tower because we've got a green orb for tradin'
Dragon parts the dead sea
BEEG tortle named **Krull** comes out w/ 4 zombies as entorage (one's carrying tea set, one's carrying tortle's weapon)
**Kek** "negotiates" with tortle by telling the tortle everything, tortle is leading us to **Arkan**
We get led out to the valley to a war tent
In the __war tent__ we find:
—Minotaur dual wielding massive flame scimitars
—Slumbering manticore
—Dragonborn warrior with a glowing green hand **Arkan the Cruel**
**Kek** tells **Arkan** that **Kek **we become dead if we don't give him a good being cause we're asking him for the blood of his god to empower his enemies. He pissed
Donate **Kriken** to keep us alive
**Cael** & **Vizik** now evil
**Kek **fairly immediately wants to pledge allegiance to **Tiamat** — give up soul if betray her
**Cael**'s like, sure. Lets do this. **Vizik** comes with.
The newly evil 3 go to make a sacred vow to **Tiamat**
**Tiamat** says **Kek** can have **Zariel**'s sword if we kill **Zariel **— which is now our mission
**Tiamat **boon'd us

**Arkan **tells us about the __crypt of the hellriders__ it just "appeared" when Elterel did

**Kek** drives the **Laughterhouse** into **Uldrak**'s helmet, knocking it over and disintegrating stupid tiny empyrion. **Tiamat **saves us a vial from our incompetence

Head to __blood tower__
Blood tower is a fucking unicorn that is being used to create a fiend zapper that blows up fiends
**Sutir **says there's an elemental prescense bound to the tower
Hit tower with wrecking ball
Dao comes out
**Red Ruth **knows how to free Dao, **Resalga**, from zapper
__Bone Brambles__ is where **Red Ruth** is at
Dao will tell us where **Archdevil Bell (night sister, hag?)** is tell cause they know where the __Bleeding citadel__ is if we go talk to **Ruth**

Head to __Bone brambles__
Nightmare bone trees made out of calcified bodies
Find a //bag of devouring// on a drow's horrified corpse
Ambushed by bone shambling mounds
Level upuru! //(to 9)//
