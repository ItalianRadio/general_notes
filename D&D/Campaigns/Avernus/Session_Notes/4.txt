Created Sunday 14 November 2021

Started at the __Bone Brambles__
In front of **Red Ruth**'s house
Talk to **Ruth** about **Resalga**
**Ruth **asks us to guard her house while she goes to take a bath
Fought a Bone Treant and a couple banshees. Treant brought its kids
There's a body in the treant - dead gnome wearing a //Hat of Disguise// and had a //Wand of the War Mage// shoved thru its body
**Ruth** tells us of the __Wandering Emporium__

We go to emporium cause it's parked outside (**Ruth** called it for a bath)
**Mahadi** runs the emporium
**The Smiler** is a green looking fae thingy - they smiley, they creepy, they want 3 people dead — Wants to lead us into battle against their foes
  - Feonor
  - Princeps Kovik
  - Bitter Breath

We go to __Blood Tower or whatever__
Trade empyrion blood for a letter from **Ralsaga** that has a location for __Bel's Forge__ and a letter of introduction to **Bel — Zariel's Advisor**, his job isn't only to advise **Zariel** at the behest of **Asmodeus** and make wares for the infernal armies to keep fighting
Cael saves unicorn cause he wants to hit the tower with a wrecking ball — Unicorn fucks off cause we're 1/2 evil

Go to __crypt of the hellriders__
Creepy as fuck tomb-place — Door is locked with some kind of magical key
**Geoff** might have something that dropped off the hellrider from __Harumon's Hill__ that might work as a key
**Vizik **thinks we might be able to loot __Elterel__ to get something to open the crypt

Go back to emporium
See a shimmering monolith on our way back
Giant slab of ice shoved into a craggy ravine — we go check it out
It's a rectangular sheet of ice/mirror jutting out of the ground — It's fucking freezing on the other side
**Sutir** gets entranced by the mirror
**Cael** fireman's him back to the car and he wakes up
**Lulu **warns us of someone coming out of the mirror — Winged Tiefling comes out of the mirror and it's got a tea kettle. Pours boiling hot water onto its head, says "Who peers into the realms of Mephistopheles"
Tells us to block the __River Styx__ near the __Pit of Shumerath__ w/ an explosive imp and he'll give us the key into the crypt.
**Cael** prays and **Tiamat** says she's totes down and that **Bell** don't like **Shumerath** so this is a win-win-win (turns out we find out later that it actually //didn't// help **Bell** but hurt him, whoops)
**Brobenoh** names explosive imp **Snowball** and he's got some shatter sticks :D

Go to pit, styx pours into the green slime. Got a dude being dunked into the pit
Save Ultraloth — Gives us //Dimensional Shackles — //Teaches us to make homunculi outta Shumerath juice
We start to blow up the ocean and a buncha spine devils try and stop us
Blow up ocean, set **Shumerath** free.
For doing this we are awarded "//For Glory//" to unlock the __Crypt of the Hellriders__
Everyone present gets +1 int or wis

Go to Crypt and dive in
**Sutir **inspects an urn and a ghostie pops out. Not big angery ghost so **Sutir **talks to it.
**Zariel** has made a deal w/ **Asmodeus** — turned into something much different than what she was in life
**Zariel**'s crusade failed. She swapped sides due to this
**Olanthias**, **Zariels**'s general, commited suicide rather than become evil. **Zariel** turned him into a death knight in death and the ghosts know that he REALLY don't like this. 
Find a //necklace of fireballs// and a //wand of secrets//
BUNCH of secret doors that have blood binding magic on them. **Sutir** burns them
**Zariel** = devil, **Olanthias** blames himself for her transformation
**Olanthias **describes a **General Yael** who hid the sword of **Zariel**, **Olanthias **respects the fuck outta him
**Olanthias** says he'll tell us where the __bleeding citadel__ is if we stop by the __Arches of Ulloch__ where we'll be teleported to **Kashtishtikai** and if we save him he'll go attack **Zariel** cause she's got his hammer, //Metallitoch//
The reason he's asking us to do this is if we go to the __bleeding citadel__ is w/out a distraction then she'll just fuck us up
He also tells us where **Zariel**'s __flying fortress__ docks and that there's a LOT of loot in there.
