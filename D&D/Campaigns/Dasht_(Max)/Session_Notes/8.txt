Churchy guy named Father Hosh, worshiper of the mother goddess Mor â€” goddess of new beginnings, is a drow, talks like a stereotypical transylvanian.
Church wasn't a church, was inn he's taking care of the homeless in his inn. Ekkie trusts him.
Zombie plague hit the town
They've been fucked by zombie plague, cut off from supplies, villagers sick with unknown disease
Zombible attack! We defend!
Zombles treat child like a football. Big Yikes
Disease is actually a slime parasite, another big yikes
Hosh tells us he knows of plants that could be used to concoct a poison that would kill the slime parasites
Ekkie's a good guy, he wants to help all these suffering people and Chauty wants to invest in an inn here so we're down to go foraging for some poisons
Head out into forest. Hag set a trap with some skelebros
Hag planeshifted away, what a bitch
Collected 3 out of the 5 poison plants we needed for the brew
Nightshade, black tree sap, corpsewood tree twigs
