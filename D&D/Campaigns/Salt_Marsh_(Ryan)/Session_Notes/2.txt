Gonna go to secret room
Secret room has bandits in it
Ekavir says, "look //then// shoot"
So Anwe looks, then charges them cause they look bandit-y
Pardner shoots off a duder's head.
One of the baddies was wearing **Mariner's Scale Mail**
Wizard baddie had a **Pipe Of Remembrance**
Demolished the baddies after the wizard attempted to set Ekavir alight
Bringing back 2 unconcious bad guys + bolts of silk and casks of brandy
Get our reward for doin the alchemist thing
Try to sell the silk & brandy, turns out it's branded by the crown
Turn in a set of silk & brandy, tells us it's worth 500 gp, so we turn in a bunch of brandy and all the silk
Pardner follows around Toffee so we can down this brandy. Toffee buys new barrels for the brandy
Then we meet up w/ Ekavir before heading to the river to transfer the brandy to the new barrels and cut the brandy w/ water so it's potable
Bobby pays for a retainer w/ the Magic Item Vendor. Zenadross (I'm def spelling that wrong... Pardner didn't go to the magic item vendor...)
