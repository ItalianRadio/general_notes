Headed to the __bleeding citadel__

Come upon iron trees on __Harumon's Hill__, buncha impaled soldiers with plaques under them
hellriders, named him prometheus, named **Jander**

They lost a fight - we Saved **Jander** from eternal torment by killing him
**Harrumon** came and beat the living shit outta me. Killed his horse and knocked him offa our car and ran the fuck outta there

decide to use figurehead as a guide cause lulu says she can't do it

come upon bearded devils w/ abyssal chickens
4 of them are picking on a 5th

Figurehead says the 5th is... //nice...// We go to rescue our future guide

**Krikendolt** enlists with us to help us get to the big sword after we killed his "buddies" because the __Bleeding citadel__ is too new for him to know where it is. That's why we went to the big sword first.

**Uldrak** wants us to go to **Arken** at __Arken's Tower__ to trade the glowy green orb that **Kek** took outta their sword for a vial of Tiamat's blood so that he can give us a biggo sword for that vial of blood

**Uldrak **told us that **Zariel **beat up **Tiamat** and wrested control of __Avernus__ from her.

**Figurehead** told us of another //celestial// located near __Fort Knucklebone__. Kek wrote down it's call __Blood Tower or whatever__

We decide to head to **Arken** because **Kek** wanna eat a sword
**Sutir** failed //a lot// of CON saves - level 3 //exhaustion//

**Kek** found out that **Kriken** was hoarding //soul coins// and was given some //demon ichor //that **Kriken** looted off his old compatriot's corpses

While we attempting to make camp, we were interrupted by a bunch of **Hell Wasps**
