Start session off with death to the moobs pig that thinks that yeenoghu will have their heads if they don't open a door
Lulu opens the chapel door and a light bathes us, we get a level and a long rest
Kek REALLY wants to eat the sword and a ghost gets mad and puts us in another Lulu dream dimension

dream dimension is covered in gnolls and gnoll-adjacents
also it's a town that's covered in fire and people are screaming
Big 6-armed snake-lady gets fucked by Cael who saves the doggo

We take a break in the church with a priest that worships Lothander
Break ends when beeg monke attacks w/ some gnoll-lookin dogs
Vizik melts the fucking gnoll-dogs (Think they're called dretches?)
Gnolls come out to sneak-attack us. they're mooks
vrock comes outta the sky. also a mook.
Yeenoguh himself comes outta thru a wall of a house
Does a shit-load of damage to us, but we fuck gnoll-sugar-daddy up and a hasted Vizik //Action Surges// to victory!

Zariel asks if we would risk all the bacon to save everyone
We answer and she gives us charms
Kek eats sword. Tiamat is mad at Vizik and Cael and undoes her blessing. Cael is appalled. He thought he did a good job.
Kek asks Arkhan if Tiamat can restore Elterell, says cool bro
Party splits up into not-Tiamat and Tiamat after we get to Elterell
