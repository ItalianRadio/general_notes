Getting ready to kill a beholder
Killed it w/ a stone wall and chance fucking pwning it
Sam contracted the gazer (Death Kiss)
They rested. A lot.
Attuned to Deadman's Gulch rift
Got 2 more aetherial crystal nodes
Gorzogg talks to Ulgrim, good buds now
They fixed Tricia right up. She says to visit her company in Homestead for a discount
Tricia loves the party now, they're guarding her caravan, she paid them in magic items
They gated away to escape Ikrix#1, killed Ikrix#2 to get to a shrine
Fixed the shrine, got a boon level 3 and leveled to level 16
