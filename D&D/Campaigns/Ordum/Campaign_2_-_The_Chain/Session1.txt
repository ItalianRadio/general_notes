====== Session1 ======
Created Monday 17 June 2019

They were given the mission by Caius & Lilith to:
* Go and find information on the artifact that's gone missing
* Not to fetch it, but to simply find clues to where it is or even what it is
* Lilith tells them she would start with jumping in the portal

Lyrean runs off and carries Rib with him. Shiro follows and scouts ahead. Morrigan sighs and summons a jet-black horse, then catches up to them.

They arrive at the enemy encampment about a week later, having traveled at a fast pace, but through terrain they knew well and find the illithid's position has been heavily fortified and guarded well, surrounded with sharpened log walls with pallisades. Stone towers have been raised, they're 50 feet tall with guards in the top. The illithids have also cleared out the forest surrounding the encampment so as to better spot intruders.

After arguing for a while, they all notice a logging camp off in the distance.

They overeagerly murder everyone in the camp - Causing all the illithids to Mind Blast at the same time, creating a HUGE raucous.

Session ended here.
