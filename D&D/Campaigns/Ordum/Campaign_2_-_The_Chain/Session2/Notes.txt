[[Planes:Cairn:Devil's Crossing:Gallows:Jarvis, Hangman|Jarvis]] informs you that you were possessed by an Aetherial and sentenced to be hanged, as all "Taken" are, but the spirit fled your body before your life ran out, and you were allowed to live. Captain John Bourbon is the one responsible for sparing you, and he wishes to speak with you.

[[Planes:Cairn:Devil's Crossing:Prison:Captain John Bourbon|Captain Bourbon]] explains that the survivors at [[Planes:Cairn:Devil's Crossing|Devil's Crossing]] are barely enduring through the relentless attacks of the Dead.
He believes they are coming from the caves beneath Burial Hill and has put it upon you to investigate, in exchange for shelter at Devil's Crossing.

Head north across the bridge and through the ruins of Lower Crossing. Once past the stream, Burial Hill will be on the left where the road forks.

A creature in the cave underneath Burial Hill is causing the Dead to rise!
Kill it and Devil's Crossing will get a needed respite from attacks.

The Reanimator is slain and the Dead should be slowed, for now.
Return to Captain John Bourbon with the good news.
