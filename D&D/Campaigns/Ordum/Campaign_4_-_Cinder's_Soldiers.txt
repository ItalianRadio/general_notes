==== Saélihn Greenthorn Backstory ====
Saélihn's fondest memory when she was younger is waking up next to a giant white wolf wrapped in its fur. While many would claim that to be alarming for her it was welcoming, she had thought of the wolf as her family she had known it since she was a baby. She did not know why she was living with the wolves or why they even accepted her, perhaps a symbosis born out necesity was in actualilty a cruel joke by a wandering fey creature. They had whisked her away from a wood elf town and charmed the wolves into accepting her as their own. Years past and the Matriarch Saélihn was bonded too had grown old knowing she was what kept her safe they left the clan to protect Saélihn. At the behest of her mother they went to a nearby village and she was to go find others that she could integrate with to live on. Her mothers final gift was to give Saélihn a good reason for them to protect her and pretended to attack Saélihn and let her daughter kill her to end this long charade.


==== The Raven Queen ====
The Raven Queen has lost control over the shadowfell and it has begun a planar merge. This is because two members of the fey court have stolen a particularly favored memory of the Raven Queen. On top of that, cultists of Vecna have an item that threatens to allow Vecna to usurp the Raven Queen in power. The Raven Queen would like your aid. For helping her, she will grant you a great boon. Additionally, should you accomplish one of these goals, she will be able to fix the tears in the dimensions. Your reality is so thin these days what with all the portals.
