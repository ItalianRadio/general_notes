Created Monday 17 June 2019

[[Planes:Cairn|Portal to Cairn]]

Named after the crater left behind by the portal that was summoned by the neogi during their 20-year war, it's currently inhabited by illithids, their spawn, and their slaves. 

The portal in the center of the crater is 10 miles in diameter, but it has shrunk since its initial creation.
The [[+illithid]] are devout in protecting the portal, erecting a massive wall that goes all the way around their terrirtory, even going as far as to bring aboleths thru the portal to guard the waters that border their new land.

The illithid are building a big anthill-like structure on the isthmus between the two countries.

There are a lot of little mounds with stone doors built into them.

There is a BIG mound near the portal - holds the [[+Brainstealer_Dragon]]

Occasional watchtowers made of stone housing Illithids and a [[+Mind_Witness]]

Blocks of stone tents scattered around, sometimes there are whole platoons of illithid sleeping in them. If the illithids are asleep there is a [[+Mind_Witness]] nearby just hovering there.

Occasionally there is a [[+Mozgriken]] cleaning or doing mundane things. They hide VERY well, so you might not even see them.

Near the water there are a bunch of [[+Chuul]] guards, occasionally they talk to the [[+Aboleth]] or the one [[+Nihilith]]. [[+Nihilith]] is surrounded by undead merfolk and triton.
