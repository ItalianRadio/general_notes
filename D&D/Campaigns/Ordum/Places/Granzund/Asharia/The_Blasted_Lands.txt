[[Planes:Cairn|Portal to Cairn]]

Named after the crater left behind by the portal that was summoned by the neogi during their 20-year war, it's currently inhabited by illithids, their spawn, and their slaves. 

The portal in the center of the crater is 10 miles in diameter, but it has shrunk since its initial creation.
The illithid are devout in protecting the portal, erecting a massive wall that goes all the way around their terrirtory, even going as far as to bring aboleths thru the portal to guard the waters that border their new land.

The illithid are building a big anthill-like structure on the isthmus between the two countries.
