====== Garmund Barony ======
Created Tuesday 28 May 2019

[[+The Chain|The Chain]]

Known to some as the Dark Plains, Garmund Barony historically was ruled by a fierce family of warriors. While they all serve Asharia as its shield they hold no loyalty to each other and have been traditionally raised to be cutthroat and merciless. When the reigning baron passes away, they declare and heir and though this should decide who is next to rule it is usually decided with honorable combat if the heirs are willing, and through assassination and trickery if there are less honorable descendants amongst the heirs. Consumed by the necessity of manning the wall and supplying troops for the war, Garmund Barony is composed almost entirely of soldiers and the towns that spring up to support and sell to them. Even the port town of Resk exists to trade with the warlike people of Fairafax so both war-like cultures can share their military advances. When the war to the north subsides the Baron of Garmund will often look to the fertile lands of the south that could further be used to feed and supply their army. No crown, only a throne represents the barony.

The PC's have been given this Barony as the last Baron gave his life defending it against the Neogi & Illithid assault while they survived, destroying the army that was beset against the United baronies.

It has expanded to include a small part of the barony to the south, Bedaghar. The Baroness of Bedaghar cares little to not about this as:
A.) She didn't want to rule in the first place
B.) She considers herself great friends with those heroes and their lot
C.) A large chunk of their court and supporting cast are from her capitol and she actually cares for them
D.) If her Barony is attacked, she is sure that they will come to her defense!
