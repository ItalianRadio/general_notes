Nik's char

Runs the chain's information network out of his brewery. 
Spends the days drinking & buying/selling information.
Likes to talk to his friends, but doesn't like seeing them as it usually means work.
Doesn't mind seeing Lilith as she just wants alcohol, which he'll readily provide.
Informally the leader of the Lowscars (thieves' guild) they pay tithe to him to operate in the area, they don't mess with those that bear the mark of the chain.
