====== Lilith ======
Created Thursday 13 June 2019

Lilith - Zealot, wants to be a lich

Does what she wants. Never seems to stop. Moves between her friends, but is constantly looking for ways to advance to the next stage of her life (Lichdom)
Occasionally patrols the surrounding area, occasionally acts as head of the state whenever Caius asks nicely. Occasionally goes to the front lines if she runs out of evildoers in her dungeon
Has a dungeon built under an amphitheatre where she practices applying the poisons and spells necessary to become a lich. She's not all that good at magic, so it's gonna take a lot of practice she says. 
Has died a few times. Not really a problem as she has her pet displacer beasts revive her.
Focused on becoming a lich.
