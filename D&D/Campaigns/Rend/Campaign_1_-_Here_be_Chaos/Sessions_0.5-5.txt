Sam (as an octopus fighter but we retconned KOTA into this), Goru'nova, & Glix head to Illuvar's lab to see why he's not reporting to his boss (her messenger never came back). Find out that the lab is booby trapped by an  AI named **S.A.M. **and that everyone is likely dead. They befriend SAM and finish their work for Rox's Roughnecks

=== Session 4 ===
Operation Dumbo Drop - Use sphere of invulnerablility to drop onto the shield. Goru'nova beats the shield's protection and they burst thru. KOTA Thundersteps them thru the portcullis, Goru'nova teleports Sonya thru the door, and Sonya lifts the giant iron blocking bar from the door, letting everyone in. They cut the portcullis' counterweights and head downstairs where KOTA feels dark magic a-brewin'. They collect magic items from the rooms where the puzzles to unlock the doors are. They get a translation broach/earring, light adamantine armor, a magic missile gun, and a med kit. Upon walking in Sonya defiantely reads the Infernal spell written in blood on the wall, cursing herself. Immediately afterword they fight Saxton, Goru'nova surprises everyone by exploding their foes with a fireball, killing most of the cultists and interrupting the ritual before it was complete. Saxton is quite easily dispatched afterward. We end the session with them looting everyone while leaving an unknown man tied up horizontally against a wall in iron cuffs.

=== Session 5 ===
A break out of shadowhell - they rescue Illuvar after looting a scimitar acidbrand from Saxton. Illuvar is an eccentric artificer. They force their way thru the castle, murdering as they go, the opposite of how they made their way in. Glix loots some livery from the officers they kill. They see a lost monster and get entranced as it murders the remaining soldiers (mostly officers) outside the portcullis. Little smiley maniacs run around chasing the remaining officers out the front gate. Our heroes ascend the castle. They see an angry monster and a devouring monster. They gaseous form to the castle's outer wall and only Glix can get thru. They discover that it's the livery that lets you thru, then hamsterball fly away into the sunset.
