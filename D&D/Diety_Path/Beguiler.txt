===== Divine Path Features =====
As a beguiler, you gain the following path features.

=== Hit Points ===
**Hit Dice:** 1d8 per beguiler rank
**Hit Points at Each Rank:** 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per beguiler rank

=== Proficiencies ===
**Armor:** Light armor, shields
**Divine Arms:** Sundial
**Skills:** Choose one from Arcana, Deception, Investigation, and Nature

== Sundial ==
The sundial is a special type of shield. In addition to granting the normal shield bonus, a sundial is a one-handed, finesse weapon that deals 1d10 piercing damage on a hit. Additionally, it can be worn while you wield a two-handed weapon, granting you a +1 shield bonus to AC while you wield a two-handed weapon.

===== Clones: =====
 A beguiler conjures and uses clones to its advantage. Clones dissipate after being struck by any damage a number of times equal to your beguiler rank. Clones share your statistics. They automatically pass all Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma saving throws and do not take damage from a passed saving throw. Clones automatically dissipate after 1 minute.
If you are not within sight, a clone is indistinguishable from you and would act as you would act. While you can say that they will attack someone, cast a spell, or something else, while they will appear to take that action, they cannot deal damage.
They can perform no actions other than movement options like jumping or climbing.
When you are present creatures that know you will innately be able to tell which is you and your closest friends will always be able to tell that your clones are not you. You can never have more clones than you beguiler rank.

===== Afflux's Shame =====
Starting when you first become a beguiler you can use an action to cast counterspell as a 3rd level spell. If a spell is successfully countered using this feature you can choose one of the following benefits:
* Heal for a number of d8's equal to twice your beguiler rank.
* Regain a spell slot of a spell level equal to or lower than your beguiler rank.
Once you use this ability you must complete a long rest before you can use it again.

===== Vecna's Deception =====
Starting at 1st rank, you can use an action to conjure a clone at your location and teleport up to 15 feet away. Foes that were within 5 feet of you make an Wisdom (Insight) check contested by your Charisma (Deception) check to recognize that the clone is not you.
 Once you have used this ability a number of times equal to you beguiler rank you cannot use it again until you have completed a short rest.
 

===== Obad-Hai's Guidance =====
At 1st rank, you can use a bonus action to cause all friendly creatures within 30 feet to regain hit points equal to five times the number of clones that you currently have conjured.
Once you have used this ability you must complete a long rest before you can use it again.
 

===== Erythnul's Sacrifice =====
Starting at 2nd rank, you can use a bonus action to shatter a clone that you can see within 60 feet. This deals a number of d8's equal to your beguiler rank as psychic damage to all foes within 15 feet of the clone. After the clone is shattered, it dissipates.

===== Garl's Image =====
At 2nd rank, you can use an action to conjure a clone in an unoccupied space you can see within 5 feet.

===== Boccob's Feast =====
When you reach 2nd rank, you can use a reaction when a foe you can see within 60 feet casts a spell to regain hit points equal to 4 times your beguiler rank.
Once you use this ability you must complete a short rest before you may use it again.

===== Wee Jas' Mirror =====
At 3rd rank, if a foe causes you to suffer from a condition you can use your reaction to force them to succeed on a Charisma saving throw or suffer the same condition. This ability does not work if the creature has immunity to said condition.

===== Delleb's Reality =====
At 4th rank you can cause your illusions to momentarily become reality. As an action you cause a clone to become more real than usual for a turn, it takes your attack action on a creature that you can see and is within range of the clone. If the clone hits the creature, it must succeed on an Wisdom (Insight) check contested by your Charisma (Deception) check to recognize that the clone is not you. It has Disadvantage on its Insight check.

===== Fharlaghn's Shift =====
Starting at 4th rank, whenever you take bludgeoning, slashing, or piercing damage you can use your reaction to conjure a clone within 10 feet of you.

===== Olidammara's Trick =====
Upon reaching 4th rank, you can use a bonus action to swap places with a clone you can see within 30 feet.
Once you use this ability a number of times equal to your beguiler rank you must finish a long rest before you can use it again.

===== Chronomancer =====
Upon reaching rank 5, you gain the title of Chronomancer.
Wizards around the world will know your name and the more magically inclined races will know your work.
In addition, you will gain the following abilities: 

==== Yondalla's Split ====
You can use an action to active a continuum split, destroying all the clones that you have conjured. For every clone that you destroyed you gain 1 turn in the continuum split. When you leave the continuum split, your body reverts back to the way that it was before the split. Your health returns to the number it was at before the split and all spells and abilities that you used in the split are not used. If you are knocked unconscious or die during the Continuum Split, at the end you return like nothing happened. You remember dying, but not what comes after.
Once you use this ability you must complete a long rest before you use it again.

==== Innoruuk's Legacy ====
Your land speed increases by 5 feet, you cannot be slowed by anything, and you cannot be restrained except by grappling and similar physical effects (You cannot be restrained by spells, even those that use force to restrain you like Bigby's hand.)
