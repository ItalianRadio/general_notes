===== Divine Path Features =====
As a beguiler, you gain the following path features.

=== Hit Points ===
**Hit Dice:** 1d8 per beguiler rank
**Hit Points at Each Rank:** 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per beguiler rank

=== Proficiencies ===
**Armor:** Light armor, shields
**Divine Arms:** Sundial
**Skills:** Choose one from Arcana, Deception, Investigation, and Nature

== Sundial ==
The sundial is a special type of shield. In addition to granting the normal shield bonus, a sundial is a one-handed, finesse weapon that deals 1d10 piercing damage on a hit. Additionally, it can be worn while you wield a two-handed weapon, granting you a +1 shield bonus to AC while you wield a two-handed weapon.

===== Death Blossom =====
Starting when you first become an assassin you learn the //Death Blossom//. An assassin is a beautiful storm of destruction in battle. Upon becoming an assassin, you begin to cause more carnage with consecutive strikes. On the third consecutive strike against the same foe with a melee weapon attack made with a finesse weapon, you deal that weapon’s damage plus your assassin rank to all foes within 5 feet of you. This damage is independent from the attack and cannot be a critical attack as it triggers after you hit the foe. These attacks need not necessarily be with the same weapon or on the same turn, but you must successfully hit a foe three times without attacking another foe for this ability to trigger

===== Shadow's Charge =====
 Starting at 1st rank, you can use half of your movement (rounded up to the nearest 5 feet) to teleport to an enemy within 30 feet of you. If you have less than half of your total health, you regain hit points equal to 3 times your assassin rank. Once you use this ability you cannot use it again until you kill a foe with a melee finesse weapon or until you complete a short or long rest. 

===== Smoke on the Wind =====
At 1st rank, if a foe you can see misses you with an attack, during your next turn you have an additional 10 movement speed. This effect does not stack. 

===== Black Spider Strike =====
Beginning at 2nd rank, as a bonus action you can prepare your blade to make an unsuspecting strike until the end of your turn. The first time you hit with a weapon attack on this turn the attack deals double weapon damage. If the attack was poisoned you deal an extra die of weapon damage plus damage equal to your assassin rank. 

===== Violent Escape =====
 At 2nd rank, as an action, you can make a melee finesse weapon attack against all foes within 5 feet of you. A creature hit with this attack must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or that creature’s movement is halved until the start of your next turn. After completing your attacks, you teleport to a space within 5 feet of an ally. After teleporting your movement is set to 0 until the end of your turn. Once you use this ability you cannot use it again until you kill a foe with a melee finesse weapon or until you complete a short rest.

===== Shadow of Haste =====
When you reach 2nd rank, as a bonus action you become one with your shadow until the end of your turn. While you are one with your shadow you have a +5 foot bonus to your land speed and your Dexterity (Acrobatics) skill has a bonus of +5. At the end of your turn you return to the location that you used this ability at. If that space is now occupied you return to a place as close as you can to that location and take 1d6 force damage for every 5 feet you were shunted. 

===== Mantis Fury =====
At 3rd rank, as a bonus action you enter the Mantis Fury stance until the end of your turn. All attacks you make while in the Locust’s Fury stance hit with both your main hand and your off hand weapon at the same time. In addition, if you take the attack action this turn, you make one extra attack. Once you use this ability you must complete a long rest before you can use it again. 

===== Piercing Strikes =====
At 4th rank, the sixth consecutive time you hit a foe, your attack will automatically become a critical hit unless the foe is immune to criticals. (This ability doesn’t make you hit, just turns hits into crits.) 

===== Shroud of Distress =====
Beginning at 4th rank, the first time your health goes below half while you still have this ability available it activates, healing you for 5 times your assassin rank and granting you bonus AC equal to your assassin rank. Once you use this ability you must complete a short rest before you can use it again. 

===== Feline Grace =====
At 4th rank, if you are within 5 feet of any surface that would grant cover while you fall, you do not take fall damage, otherwise, fall damage you take is halved. Additionally, you have Advantage on Dexterity (Acrobatics) checks. 

===== Daredevil =====
Upon reaching rank 5, you gain the title of Daredevil. You are a legend amongst both theives and their guilds along with monks and their temples. While your guise may not be recognized amongst these folks, that's too be expected as you are the assassin, their hero as well as their nightmare. In addition, you will gain the following abilities:

==== Monkey Strength ====
If you run in a straight line at least 10 feet before jumping you can use your action on this ability. If you succeed on an Dexterity (Acrobatics) check with a DC of 20, you may choose a location somewhere within 40 feet from where you jumped. After landing you may make a single attack on all enemies within your reach. Upon landing your movement speed is set to 0. If you fail the jump check this ability fails and you may take a different action. You may not use this ability with Locust’s Fury. Once you use this ability, even if you fail, you must complete a long rest before you can use it again. 

==== Mastery of Self ====
If a foe you can see misses you with an attack, the next time you deal damage with an attack on your next turn you deal bonus damage equal to your weapon die. This effect stacks.
